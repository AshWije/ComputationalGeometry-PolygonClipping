# Polygon-Clipping

This repository includes the implementation of three well-known algorithms designed for solving
the problem of polygon clipping, namely Greiner-Hormann, Sutherland-Hodgman, and Weiler-Atherton.
This is done in order to better understand the different algorithms and to compare the results
of these algorithms via experimentation.

**Polygon Clipping Problem**: Given two polygons, *C* and *S*, (the clip polygon and subject
polygon respectively) the goal is to output the set of polygons made from the portions of
polygon *S*â€™s boundary that lie within polygon *C*.
